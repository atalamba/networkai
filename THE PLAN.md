THE PLAN
Phase 1: functionality
DONE 1)	CSS make it pretty  
DONE 2) See the profile to make sure the message is correct 

3)	Automatic email finding for that person DONE
4) Add different prompts for different cases 
NOW ABLE TO START.
ONCE 10-20-150 is done:

FULL AUTOMATION: what is needed:
Be able to provide a single list of emails, or even better, an excel sheet, or paste everything as one.
Then mass produce emails
Access to my calendar and emails for direct sending

how this must work:
be able to save a template in the database (let's do local storage for now.)
Inputs:
list of people, companies, parsed into a usable array
provide and save templates.

Header: 
Start automation
Add template (it will be a popup)

when you click "start automation":
provide the names and the people and the companies and potentially the emails. Transform into an array
Have a view as such: 
The people you contacted in a list, and their respective template
Then either start one email generation, or start all 

Be able to see the results, modify, send again.


I) template part




















!!! Automatic calendar checking against all the meetings you already have, for proper availibility section

4)	Integrated search bar to find by company or by name
Optional: Accept a list of names and companies and roles (coming from a networking sheet) connected to the search function for finding their profiles

5)	Aggregation: write to all junior bankers at the company, write to all people named john…



Phase 2: users
6)	Add authentication (useful for later)

7)	SQL database with manual input:
Message history, if you had calls, what you talked about, any other people they told you to talk to (SQL comes in clutch)

8)	Relationship management dashboard, based on the database
X hasn’t responded to your initial outreach: follow up?
On your call with Y, he recommended you talk to Z. Send her a message?
You just had a call with Z. Send a thank you note?
You haven’t talked with Z in 3 weeks. Ask for a new call?

9)	AMBITIOUS: nodemailer, with .ics calendar invites.

11)	Improve if necessary
