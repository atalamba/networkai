(not perfect but it's something)

Getting started:
git clone https://github.com/atalamba/networkai

cd frontend
npm run dev


OTHER TERMINAL:
cd backend
create a venv
try running it and see what libraries are missing, install those

to run backend:
python app.py

Works like half of the time but have other things to do than this
